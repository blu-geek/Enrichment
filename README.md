# CRM Enrichment

‚ùì What Problem Does This Solve?

Manual lead enrichment is slow, inconsistent, and drains valuable time. This solution automates the process using a no-code workflow that connects HubSpot, Bright Data MCP, and an AI agent‚Äîwithout requiring scripts or technical skills. Perfect for marketing, sales, and RevOps teams.

üß∞ Prerequisites

# To use this template, you‚Äôll need:

A self-hosted or cloud instance of N8N
A Bright Data MCP API token
A valid OpenAI API key (or compatible AI model)
A HubSpot account
Either a Private App token or OAuth credentials for HubSpot
Basic familiarity with N8N workflows
‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. Set Up Authentication in HubSpot

üîê Option 1: Use a Private App Token (Simple Setup)

Log in to your HubSpot account.
Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Private Apps.
Create a new Private App with the following scopes:
crm.objects.contacts.read
crm.objects.contacts.write
crm.schemas.contacts.read
crm.objects.companies.read (optional)
Copy the Access Token.
In N8N, create a credential for HubSpot App Token and paste the app token in the field.
Go back to Hubspot Private App settings to setup a webhook.
Copy the url in your workflow's Webhook node and paste it here.

üîÅ Option 2: Use OAuth (Advanced + Secure)

In HubSpot, go to Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Create App.
Set your Redirect URL to match your N8N OAuth2 redirect path.
Choose scopes like:
crm.objects.companies.read
crm.objects.contacts.read
crm.objects.deals.read
crm.schemas.companies.read
crm.schemas.contacts.read
crm.schemas.deals.read
crm.objects.contacts.write (conditionally required)
Note the Client ID and Client Secret.
Copy the App ID and the developer API key

In N8N, create a credential for HubSpot Developer API and paste those info from previous step.
Attach these credentials to the HubSpot node in N8N.

2. Setup and obtain API token and other necessary information from Bright Data

In your Bright Data account, obtain the following information:

API token
Web Unlocker zone name (optional)
Browser API username and password string separated by colon (optional)

3. Host SSE server from STDIO command

# The methods below will allow you to receive SSE (Server-Sent Events) from Bright Data MCP via a local Supergateway or Smithery

## Method 1: Run Supergateway in a separate web service (Recommended)

This method will work for both cloud version and self-hosted N8N.

Signup to any cloud services of your choice (DigitalOcean, Heroku, Hetzner, Render, etc.).

# For NPM based installation:

- Create a new web service.
Choose Node.js as runtime environment and setup a custom server without repository.
In your server‚Äôs settings to define environment variables or .env file, add:
API_TOKEN=your_brightdata_api_token WEB_UNLOCKER_ZONE=optional_zone_name BROWSER_AUTH=optional_browser_auth
Paste the following text as a start command: npx -y supergateway --stdio "npx -y @brightdata/mcp" --port 8000 --baseUrl http://localhost:8000 --ssePath /sse --messagePath /message
Deploy it and copy the web server URL, then append /sse into it.
Your SSE server should now be accessible at: https://your_server_url/sse

# For Docker based installation:

-Create a new web service.
Choose Docker as the runtime environment.
Set up your Docker environment by pulling the necessary images or creating a custom Dockerfile.
In your server‚Äôs settings to define environment variables or .env file, add:
API_TOKEN=your_brightdata_api_token WEB_UNLOCKER_ZONE=optional_zone_name BROWSER_ZONE=optional_browser_zone_name
- Use the following Docker command to run Supergateway: docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 supercorp/supergateway \ --stdio "npx -y @brightdata/mcp /" \ --port 8000
Deploy it and copy the web server URL, then append /sse into it.
Your SSE server should now be accessible at: https://your_server_url/sse
For more installation guides, please refer to https://github.com/supercorp-ai/supergateway.git.

## Method 2: Run Supergateway in the same web service as the N8N instance

This method will only work for self-hosted N8N.

a. Set Required Environment Variables

In your server's settings to define environment variables or .env file, add:

API_TOKEN=your_brightdata_api_token
WEB_UNLOCKER_ZONE=optional_zone_name
BROWSER_ZONE=optional_browser_zone_name

b. Run Supergateway in Background

npx -y supergateway --stdio "npx -y @brightdata/mcp" --port 8000 --baseUrl http://localhost:8000 --ssePath /sse --messagePath /message
Use the command above to execute it through the cloud shell or set it as a pre-deploy command.

Your SSE server should now be accessible at:
http://localhost:8000/sse

For more installation guides, please refer to https://github.com/supercorp-ai/supergateway.git.

Method 3: Configure via Smithery.ai (Easiest)
If you don't want additional setup and want to test it right away, follow these instructions:

Visit https://smithery.ai/server/@luminati-io/brightdata-mcp/tools to:

Signup (if you are new to Smithery)
Create an API key
Define environment variables via a profile
Retrieve your SSE server HTTP URL

4. Connect Google Sheets to N8N

Ensure your Google Sheet:

Contains columns like row_id, first_name, last_name, email, and status.
Is shared with your N8N service account (or connected via OAuth)
In N8N:

Add a Google Sheets Trigger node
Set it to watch for new rows in your lead sheet
5. Import and Configure the N8N Workflow

Import the provided JSON workflow into N8N
Update nodes with your credentials:
Hubspot: Add your API key or connect it via OAuth.
Google Sheets Trigger: Link to your actual sheet
OpenAI Node: Add your API key
Bright Data Tool Execution: Add Bright Data token and SSE URL
üîÑ How It Works

New contact in Hubspot or a new row is added to the Google Sheet
N8N triggers the workflow
AI agent classifies the task (e.g., ‚ÄúFind LinkedIn‚Äù, ‚ÄúGet company info‚Äù)
The relevant MCP tool is called
Results are appended back to the sheet or routed to another destination
Rerun the specific record by specifying status "needs more enrichment", or leaving it blank.
